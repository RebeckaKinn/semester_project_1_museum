<p id="description">
This project is a static website created as part of an HTML & CSS course assignment.  
The goal was to design an engaging and responsive website for the fictional <b>Community Science Museum</b>, targeting children aged 7–15 and families with young children.
</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> The project has later been improved with small JavaScript enhancements for cleaner structure and component handling.</p>

<h2>📖 About the Project</h2>

This website was built using <b>HTML and CSS</b> and demonstrates:

- Semantic HTML structure  
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop  
- Accessibility considerations (WCAG basics)  
- Clean visual layout with focus on typography and colour  
- Optimised images for fast loading  
- SEO basics like meta tags and alt text  

I later added in JS to create reusable components.
The design was first created in Figma and then implemented using a mobile-first approach.
